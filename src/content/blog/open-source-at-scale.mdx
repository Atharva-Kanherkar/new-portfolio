excerpt: "It's not about writing code. It's about reviewing it, protecting it, and letting go of it."

Before my LFX mentorship at the Linux Foundation, I thought open source was about code. You find a project, write a fix, submit a PR, and move on. That's the mythology, anyway.

The reality is closer to gardening than engineering.

## The maintenance trap

When you maintain a repository that other people depend on, most of your time isn't spent writing features. It's spent reading. Reading pull requests from contributors who have different assumptions about the codebase than you do. Reading issues that describe symptoms, not causes. Reading CI logs for environments you don't have access to.

At Palisadoes, I review more PRs in a week than I write in a month. Each one requires context-switching into someone else's mental model of the system, evaluating not just "does this work?" but "does this fit?"

## The art of saying no

The hardest skill in open source isn't writing code — it's declining contributions gracefully. A well-intentioned PR that doesn't align with the project's direction costs more to maintain than it saves. But the person who submitted it spent hours on it, and they're often a first-time contributor.

The balance is: be honest about why something doesn't fit, be kind about how you say it, and always point toward what *would* be helpful.

## Documentation as infrastructure

At Zowe, my first major contribution wasn't code at all. It was rewriting the onboarding documentation. The existing docs assumed knowledge that new contributors didn't have, creating an invisible barrier.

Good docs aren't a nice-to-have. They're load-bearing infrastructure. Every hour spent on documentation saves ten hours of answering questions in Slack.

## What I carry forward

Open source taught me that software is a social system. The code is just the artifact. The real work is in the communication, the standards, and the patience to keep a codebase healthy over years, not just sprints.
