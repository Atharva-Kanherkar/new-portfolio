excerpt: "Mapping ancient epics onto geographic data — and what it teaches about narrative UI."

The Ramayana is, among many things, a journey. Rama's exile traces a path across the Indian subcontinent — from Ayodhya south through Chitrakoot, across the Vindhyas, down to Lanka, and back. It's a story that moves through space.

When I started the Ramayana Atlas project, the question wasn't "can we map this?" — it was "what happens to a narrative when you give it geography?"

## Stories want to be spatial

Most interfaces for exploring literature are linear — you read from beginning to end, maybe with a search function. But epics like the Ramayana aren't just temporal sequences. They're *spatial narratives*. Places recur. Routes overlap. The geography shapes the plot.

A map makes these patterns visible in a way that a text never can. You can see that Rama's path forms a rough loop. You can see the distances involved — months of travel compressed into a few verses. You can see how strategic the geography of Lanka is.

## The data problem

Ancient texts don't come with coordinates. Place names have shifted over centuries. Some locations are contested by scholars. Others are mythological, with no direct geographic referent.

This is where AI becomes interesting — not as a replacement for scholarship, but as a tool for *navigating ambiguity*. Claude can surface multiple scholarly interpretations of a location, present the evidence for each, and let the user decide. The map becomes a space for exploration, not a claim of authority.

## What narrative UI means

Building this project changed how I think about interfaces. A good narrative UI isn't just a pretty wrapper around data. It's a *structure that reveals meaning*.

The map doesn't just show where things happened — it shows *why the journey matters*. The distances make the exile feel real. The terrain makes the challenges tangible. The return route makes the homecoming resonate.

This is what I mean by "narrative UI" in my portfolio — interfaces that don't just display information but tell a story through their structure. The medium isn't just the message. The medium *is* the understanding.

## Lessons for other projects

Every dataset has a spatial or structural dimension that's usually invisible. Codebases have dependency graphs. Conversations have branching threads. Even a todo list has a topology of blocked and blocking tasks.

The lesson from cartography is simple: if you can find the right projection, the structure becomes the interface.
